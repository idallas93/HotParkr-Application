## Description

HotParkr is a fullstack MERN social connection app based on the dog park community. It is hard to meet new people generally but much easier to do so when dogs are involved, you're socially distanced, and outside at a local dog park. HotParkr allows users to find dog parks near them, find information about their local dog parks, blog about those parks, and most importantly connect with other users who frequent the local dog parks to form a dog park community!
